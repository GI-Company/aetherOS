# **App Name**: AetherOS

## Core Features:

- Kernel & Resource Management: Dynamic Resource Scheduler: AI-driven system that intelligently allocates Web Worker threads, memory, and network priority. Native API Bridge: A secure, permission-controlled interface for accessing browser-level capabilities.
- Window Management System: Full virtual desktop support with customizable gestures, animated transitions, and persistent app layouts per desktop. AI-Enhanced Global Command Palette.
- Sandboxed Application Execution: Process Isolation model with each app/task running in an isolated environment. WebAssembly Micro-Kernel: Explore running core application logic within WebAssembly modules. Permission Granularity: OS-level permissions dialog.
- Persistent Storage & Universal Resource Management: Hierarchical, tag-based virtual file system with global search and indexing. Distributed Storage Integration: Seamlessly integrate with cloud storage providers. Semantic Search & Organization (AI-Driven).
- Pixel Streamer: Foundational rendering engine for all graphical output. Composable UI Render Targets. Neural Rendering Pipeline (Experimental): AI-assisted rendering techniques.
- Aether-Architect Core: AI Persona as the core intelligence of the OS with Proactive OS Assistance, Thought Streams (AI Reasoning Transparency), Universal Natural Language Interface using a tool.
- AI-Powered Code Assistant: Code generation based on design patterns, architectural style guides, and visual mockups. Intelligent Refactoring Agent: Analyzes codebases and proposes complex refactoring operations using a tool.
- Automated UI/UX Testing & Design Assistant: Actively designs and prototypes UI components and user flows based on requirements. Design by Prompt UI Generation. Heuristic UX Analysis: AI continuously monitors user interactions and suggests UI/UX improvements.
- Multi-User Collaboration: Real-time sharing of virtual desktops or specific app instances. Integrated video conferencing and screen sharing. Shared OS Sessions with granular access controls. Collaborative Sandboxes.
- Visual Workflow Orchestration: OS Events as Triggers. AI-Generated Workflows: Describe a complex process in natural language, and the AI generates the Osbidibi workflow.
- Aether-Architect App Store / Ecosystem: A curated marketplace for browser-native apps. SDK & Developer Tools: API access to AI services, window manager, and persistent storage.
- Embedded Virtual Machine: A complete, sandboxed virtual machine environment for executing operating systems and applications within the browser.

## Style Guidelines:

- Dynamic themes (light/dark mode, accent color customization). AI-driven adaptive color palettes that subtly shift based on the dominant content or active application.
- Offer Spaces – distinct virtual desktops, each with its own saved layout and running applications. Activity-based workspaces – layouts that auto-configure for specific tasks.
- Holographic UI Elements (Subtle): Leverage WebGL/WebGPU for subtle depth and parallax effects.
- Dynamic font scaling based on user preferences, display size, and AI-predicted readability needs.
- Icons are context-aware, subtly changing appearance or animation based on application state or user focus. More extensive set for OS-level actions.
- All OS interactions are imbued with fluid, physics-based animations.
- Cognitive Load Adaptive Animations: The AI can subtly adjust animation speed, duration, or intensity based on the user's measured cognitive load or stress level.
- Intent-Driven Micro-Interactions: UI elements might subtly guide the user towards the next logical step based on AI predictions of user intent.
- A deep space blue (#0B0D1A) for the primary color evokes a professional and sophisticated feel, mirroring the virtual desktop in the reference image.
- Dark charcoal gray (#1E212B) for the background color to reduce eye strain and enhance focus, consistent with the windows and desktop in the reference image.
- An electric purple (#BE95FF) highlights interactive elements and AI-driven suggestions, providing visual distinction to guide user attention as in the Aether Eatter code window and AI refactoring agent.
- A modular, pane-based layout ensures that all UI elements (Virtual Filesydon, code editor, visual workflow, and pixel streamer) are readily and quickly accessible for optimal usability.
- Windows have rounded corners, floating above the rest of the UI, and include a minimize, maximize and close window, reminiscent of the Aether Architect interface.
